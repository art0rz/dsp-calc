# [bcp-calc](https://art0rz.github.io/dsp-calc/)
This is the repository for the [Dyson Sphere Program Calculator](https://art0rz.github.io/dsp-calc/), a tool for calculating resource requirements and production ratios in the game Dyson Sphere Program.

This tool was heavily inspired by [Factorio Calculator](https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/calc.html).

# Tech
This tool was built coded in TypeScript. It uses React (create-react-app) as a UI library, [Blueprintjs](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint) for UI elements, and SCSS for styling.

# Current status
Currently, the calculator only does one thing; calculating resource requirements. The data is currently incomplete, and some dummy data has been added for testing purposes.

In the future, I hope to add the following features:

- visualizer (see Factorio Calculator)
- power requirements
